        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Dan Carlin is a name that will be familiar to many of you as the creator of one
                of the most widely listened to podcasts in America, Hardcore History. A smaller
                fraction of you, if you have lived in Toluca Lake since the 1970s, may have actually
                known Dan or the Carlin family personally. It recently came to my attention that Carlin,
                a man whose work I greatly admire and whose voice I have listened to for over 100 hours,
                had lived in Toluca Lake and in fact grew up with some of my closest family friends.
                <br><br>
                Upon learning this, I knew I had to reach out to Carlin, and thankfully, Dan could not
                have been more receptive. I was thrilled to receive a response, and even more excited
                that Carlin was eager to talk and fondly remembered our mutual friends. Carlin graciously
                offered his time for a lengthy and wide-ranging interview over the phone with The Tolucan
                Times. Carlin was phenomenally kind, open, and a model interviewee, which should come
                as no surprise considering he has made a living as an eloquent communicator.
                <br><br>
                Carlin started his career in journalism originally working at KJH-TV, which would later
                become KCAL. “I got a coffee-getter, intern-runner, gofer type job at channel 9,”
                Right on cue, Dan had a history tidbit to share about channel 9’s history. “This is how
                old [KJH-TV’s] manager was. It was an RKO General station. I think RKO General was a tire
                company in the Depression, and they bought a bunch of media outlets, and by the time I
                worked there, they were still hobbling along with something they didn’t even know why
                they still owned anymore. I’m not even sure they still sold tires at that point. And while
                I was there, it got bought by Disney.” Dan’s story checks out, a tire company called
                General Tire owned channel 9 in Los Angeles from 1951 until 1989. He continued to work
                there under Disney for a while. “From there I got a job – I didn’t want one – but the
                guys at KABC were pushing me saying: ‘You know, you’ll die at this job if you don’t
                keep moving up the ladder.’ They were encouraging me to be a reporter. And I think to
                just shut them up, I sent out some tapes because nobody was getting hired who were
                sending out tapes, so I didn’t think it was much of a risk. I got hired in Eugene,
                Oregon. So I moved up here, became a TV reporter, and moved over to talk radio.”
                <br><br>
                Carlin’s career in broadcast journalism clearly served as a foundation for his future career
                in podcasting, but I wondered too if his upbringing in Toluca Lake, a neighborhood known for
                its many entertainers, influenced his gravitation towards entertaining others. “It’s funny
                because I often think back to Toluca Lake, and I’ll tell my wife, who’s from Oregon, stories
                about [Toluca Lake] and it’s different now than it was then. When I think of what the parents
                of all of the kids that I knew did, it was two general areas of employment: Either the
                entertainment industry – in front of behind the camera – or aerospace.” Unsurprisingly,
                again, Carlin was ready to teach me a bit of history that I didn’t know, but this time about
                our neighborhood. “There were a ton of people that worked Lockheed, McDonnell, Douglas,
                you know, all of those kinds of firms. My next-door neighbor’s dad was an Air Force colonel
                who worked for Lockheed, and there were a lot of those guys. That seemed to be like that
                because Lockheed was huge and it probably was not so huge by your time, but this was the Cold
                War, you know? I moved to Toluca Lake late 1960s, and it was a huge industry in the Valley.”
                <br><br>
                Today, I doubt many of us think of Toluca Lake as a neighborhood that caters specifically
                to military contractors, but I’m sure there are still a few in our midst. Carlin’s family
                belonged to the other of the two major industries at the time in the area: entertainment.
                His mother, Lynn Carlin, was an actress in the 70s and 80s when Dan was growing up. She has
                over 60 on-screen credits, including a starring role alongside Toluca Lake’s late, great
                honorary sheriff (and Dan Carlin’s first little league coach) Joe Campanella in the 1974
                film Terror on the 40th Floor. Carlin has been an undeniable trailblazer in the world of
                podcasting having first entered the sphere in 2005, long before the podcasting boom with
                his show Hardcore History that now receives millions of downloads per episode. “When we
                started in 2005, we started the very month that Apple started supporting podcasts. So we
                really didn’t think anybody knew what [podcasting] was going to be. Most of the people
                doing this were like nerds in their dorm rooms in college just reading stuff into a microphone
                or whatever. I mean, it was just so eclectic and weird and strange that I don’t think any
                of us really grasp what any of this was.”
                <br><br>
                Carlin told me that he has always been fond of his time in Toluca Lake, where he lived for
                the first twelve years of his life in houses on both Navajo and Rose. “That’s my foundational
                place,” he said of our neighborhood and went on to share some charming stories from that time
                in Toluca Lake’s history. “Did anybody ever mention the candy ladies to you?” Carlin asked me.
                “There were two – and I always think of them as old women but I thought about it the other day and they
                probably were my age – but these women were the candy ladies,” Carlin explained joyfully. “If you would
                knock on
                their door and you were a child, they didn’t even ask anything they just came to the door with a whole
                tureen
                of candy. They would come any hour, day or night and do this. And every kid, of course, in the
                neighborhood knew about this. It was it was a landmark.”
                <br><br>
                Carlin remarked too how the times have changed and the thought of sending one’s kids to the
                mysterious candy ladies’ house would be almost unthinkable to many parents today.
                On the topic of the Toluca Lake that he grew up in, Carlin told me a couple of his favorite old spots.
                “One place that I used to go to that my dad would roll his eyes when I made him go there was called
                Saint
                George Smorgasbord. It had like a knightly theme, Knights of the Round Table kind of thing. But it was a
                smorgasbord, so it had every kind of food you can imagine. It would have been like an upscale version of
                Golden Corral or something.”
                Another old favorite Carlin mentioned that I’m sure many readers will recall: The Hot Dog Show, which
                was
                a Toluca Lake staple for 62 years before it closed its doors in 2011.
                It was an incredible honor and pleasure to speak with Dan, and I want to leave you all with some of his
                words about Toluca Lake and what it has meant to him throughout his life.
                “It’s so funny that just in my little town here where I live in Eugene, Oregon, it just reminds me of
                how I felt in Toluca Lake when I was a kid. Just because the big, wide world of Los Angeles really
                wasn’t
                a part of my life, you know? What was a part of my life was from Riverside Drive to Lakeside Golf
                Course.
                <br><br>
                That little square area that was my whole world, and it was nice. It was green; it was safe,
                and that’s kind of how this community where I live right now is. It reminds me a little of how
                my mom always said I was looking to get back to Toluca Lake ever since we left.”
